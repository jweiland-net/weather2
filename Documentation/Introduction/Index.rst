What does it do?
================

This extension is mainly used to display weather data received from
openweathermap.org and weather alerts received from Deutscher Wetterdienst.
The extension however is designed to work with every weather api by creating
your own scheduler (Symfony Console Commands since verson 6) and map values to
the existing database structure. Moreover it is possible to organize records
using storage pages and a custom identifier for each record.
